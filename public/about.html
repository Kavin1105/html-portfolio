<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi!, I'm Kavin currently going through a quarter-life crisis of why I chose Electrical and Electronics Engineering as my UG course. I'm interested in neither of them, I just got fooled by some clever marketing of a college's (which shall not be named) placement statistics and ended up taking something that I wasn't interested in in the first place. Nevertheless, I'm stuck with the options that I currently have.
</p>

<p>Enough of my regrets, now let's see what intrigues me. Ever since my childhood days, I used to play a lot of video games on my PC ranging from various genres such as racing, sports,open-world, Story/Campaign mode games, and so on... I like to watch and play numerous sports like cricket, football, tennis, badminton, chess, basketball, F1. You could also say that I'm a cinephile, I have watched hundreds and hundreds of films, TV series, and shows, and also a few animes to add to it. Most of the movies I have watched are from Hollywood, like the Marvel Franchise films, and also a huge fan of Christopher Nolan. I used to be heavily distracted with my phone scrolling reels on Instagram minute in and minute out, I'm slowly recovering from my social media and phone addiction, reducing my screen time gradually.

<p>So Career-wise if you see, I aspire to become a Software developer Engineer. I've started my journey in learning Data Structures and algorithms and have also enrolled myself in an online course provided by UDEMY known as The Complete Web Development BootCamp by Angela Yu. I hope to master the required skills and get placed as an SDE at a product-based company one day.</p>
